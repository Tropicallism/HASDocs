# Tickets
Oh boy! A new Ticket system? Is it my birthday?

Anyway, yes, we do have a ticket system. Used for any kind of things, reporting, questions, important inquires etc. So how do you use it?

## Usage
So, you want to go to #tickets. After that do ;Ticket New [Message] after you do this, a new channel will appear (Wow, the power of coding!)
In this channel, your question will be answered. After it's been answered or not answered depending on the situation, you can do
;Ticket Close then /confirm. This will delete the channel yeah.

## Limitations
Yes, there are limitations regarding the Tickets function.

Just kidding, there's only 1 limitation of the tickets, you can only send a ticket every 6 hours!
