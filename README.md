# Suspended
So, what do you do when you're suspended? When you're suspended, you don't really get banned, because it hasn't come to that point yet... but you do lose access to the Discord channel, you can only see Rules and the Suspended Channel.

## How do I get unsuspended?
Well, depending on your situation, you can contact a staff member (Head Moderator) and above. Just go through the preocedre.

## I've been suspended, but haven't done anything?
If you haven't done anything and gotten suspended, there might be a couple of reasons why:

### You're being tested from Tropical
Yes, sometimes Tropical does do test commands on you but forgets to re-add your roles (Not all the time) but if you contact Tropical and he says he didn't do anything, probally means you're actually suspended!

### There was a AA (Admin Abuse)
When someone has full access, they can do a lot of things that we don't want to happen. So, when the server is being AA'ed, you might be suspended. We'll solve the problem ASAP.

## Suspended Falsely
Either it's someone you have beef with, or something just done in anger, and you do KNOW that you've been suspended falsely, please contact any other staff members to get it resolved.
