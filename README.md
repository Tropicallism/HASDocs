## What does this bot do?
Well, it does a lot of things, from kick-ban and all other fun commands, it's just a bot used for moderation and controlling the server. I've made many commands



## What does the version mean for HAS?
Well, it's really simple to answer.

Let's start with the first number,
**1.X.X**
This is the bot's "prestiege". The higher the first number it is, the higher the bot has been updated in total.
How about the second number?
**X.1.X**
The second number is when something has changed about the bot, such as major changes to a command or a new command entirely.
How about the last number?
**X.X.1**
This is basically quick fixes.
You may be saying **OH TROPICAL THERE'S ANOTHER NUMBER**
Yes, there might be another number in the version line, but that maybe just added there for another reason...

Now what's the word before the version? That's the prestiege word, it goes in aplphabetical order, such as A,B,C. You can also know the prestiege number by looking at the first number. The higher that number is, the more updates it has been done for.
